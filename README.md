MERN stack boilerplate - MongoDB ExpressJS React and NodeJS

This is a boilerplate app for use to create MERN stack apps. It is a basic installation of the main components above, with added tests and some example code to follow. Using Webpack for buids, Mocha, Chai and Enzyme for testing, Babel for ES6 transpiling.

### Installing 

 1. `git clone git@github.com:davidthingsaker/MERNStack.git myApp`
 2. `npm install`

 Make sure you also have mongoDB running. This will differ depending on how you are using mongoDB but for me on OS X having installed it via Homebrew:

 `mongod`

 That's it! 

 If you would like to run the tests use: 

 `npm test`
